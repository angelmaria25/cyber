                <h2>Physical protection</h2>
                <p>Physical security encompasses strategies and measures implemented to protect personnel, assets, and information from unauthorized access, damage, theft, or other security breaches.</p>
                <p>Physical security serves as the first line of defense in safeguarding an organizationâ€™s critical assets. While cybersecurity protects against digital threats, physical security focuses on protecting employees, equipment, data, and facilities from theft, unauthorized access, and natural disasters. The absence of effective physical security measures can result in severe consequences, including data breaches, financial losses, and potential threats to human safety. By implementing comprehensive physical security strategies, organizations create a secure environment for employees and visitors while ensuring the protection of vital data and assets.</p>
